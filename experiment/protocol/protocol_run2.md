# Simulation Protocol Results

**Problem:** How do we build a retirement system for people who don't know how much they will earn next month, where 'consistency' is impossible?

**Context:** Traditional retirement systems (401k, pensions, IRAs) assume regular income and consistent contributions. This excludes ~36% of the US workforce engaged in gig work, freelancing, seasonal employment, or informal economy.

**Seeds:** coralline, unimpatient, pilaued, displacement, theatrical

## World 1: CORALLINE

### World Rules
Nothing exists in isolation. All structures form through slow accumulation of countless tiny contributions that branch, calcify, and form interdependent reef-like systems. Growth must fork (branching necessity), every action requires a partner-action (symbiotic metabolism), and once enough micro-contributions aggregate, structures achieve self-sustaining "reef-state."

### Solution: Micro-Deposit Reef System
- **Scatter-Contribution Protocol**: Measure ACTIVITY not INCOME. Tiny "coral dust" accretes from every transaction regardless of size.
- **Branching Requirement**: Three simultaneous streams—Self-Branch (your deposits), Guild-Branch (trade network contributions), Commons-Branch (collective redistribution)
- **Symbiotic Pairing**: When client pays you, BOTH parties accrete. More economic connection = faster growth, not more wealth.
- **Reef-State Threshold**: Critical mass becomes self-sustaining
- **Thin-Season Protocol**: Gaps don't shrink your reef—Guild and Commons branches keep growing on your behalf

### Extracted Mechanism
**Label: PORTABLE**

**Core Principle:** Distributed Micro-Accumulation Through Activity and Relational Networks

**Formula:** Frequency × Connections × Collective Backup = Resilience

### Bridge to Reality
1. **Activity-Based Micro-Deposits**: Partner with payment processors for opt-in micro-savings per transaction (flat amount, not percentage)
2. **Guild Branch**: Sector-specific retirement cooperatives (Freelance Writers Guild Retirement Pool)
3. **Symbiotic Pairing**: Platform cooperatives where client AND freelancer both get micro-contributions
4. **Commons Branch**: Mutual aid fund redistributing to thin accounts
5. **No-Penalty Pauses**: Accounts that don't penalize gaps—no fees during zero-income months

**Most Actionable:** A gig platform implementing transaction-based micro-deposits for both client and freelancer

## World 2: UNIMPATIENT

### World Rules
Nothing of value can be created quickly—this is physics. The worth of outcomes is proportional to duration of becoming. Sustained attention compounds value; gaps reset compounding. Time investment is visible (things "glow" with accumulated attention). Premature withdrawal destroys value.

### Solution: Attention-Anchored Retirement Vessels
- **Tending Ritual**: 10 seconds daily attention to maintain compounding—costs nothing financially
- **Variable Deposits as Fertilizer**: Deposits accelerate, but BASE GROWTH comes from unbroken attention
- **Guilds of Mutual Tending**: 10-20 members handle emergency tending during illness/crisis
- **Micro-Duration Tokens**: Smallest possible units creating "rolling harvests" vs single retirement date
- **Staged Ripening**: 5yr emergency, 15yr mid-life, 30yr retirement depth levels

**Key Insight:** "The vessel doesn't care how much you put in. It cares that you never looked away."

### Extracted Mechanism
**Label: PORTABLE**

**Core Principle:** Behavioral Consistency as the Primary Asset—decouple contribution size from growth eligibility, couple behavioral continuity to growth eligibility

### Bridge to Reality
**"Streak-Based Retirement Account":**
1. **Zero-minimum deposits**: $0.01 maintains the streak
2. **Streak bonuses**: 30-day streak = 0.25% bonus; 365-day = 1% annual bonus
3. **Streak insurance**: $1/month for 3 grace days/year
4. **Pod system**: 10 people can gift check-ins to each other 2x/year
5. **Visual vessel**: Growing visualization that dims when you haven't checked in

**Key Insight:** For irregular earners, the hardest part isn't the money—it's staying in the system. Design for continuity of participation, not continuity of deposits.

## World 3: PILAUED (Layered)

### World Rules
Nothing can exist in singular, homogeneous state. Everything must be stratified into at least three distinct layers. More layers = more structural strength. Similar layers across different objects can transfer energy instantaneously (resonant stacking). Living things cycle by shedding outer layers while growing inner ones.

### Solution: Three-Layer Contribution Architecture
- **Layer 1 (Shed)**: Every transaction auto-sheds 1-3% into retirement—passive, constant
- **Layer 2 (Tension)**: Surge captures activate during income surges, automatically capturing excess
- **Layer 3 (Core)**: Community pools around shared purposes—benefits from resonant stacking when cohort has good periods
- **Resonance Cohorts**: Group by income PATTERN (seasonal, project-based, daily-variable), not amount
- **Three-Channel Communication**: Numbers + Rhythm visualization + Purpose-cohort connection

### Extracted Mechanism
**Label: PORTABLE**

**Core Principle:** Stratified Automation with Peer Cohort Pooling—group people by income PATTERN similarity for natural mutual aid

**Key Innovation:** Grouping by income *pattern* rather than income *level* for mutual aid pooling

### Bridge to Reality
**"RhythmRetire" Product:**
1. **Layer 1**: Auto-transfer 2% of every deposit to IRA (via Plaid)
2. **Layer 2**: ML detects "above-pattern" income, prompts surge capture
3. **Layer 3**: Opt into affinity cohorts; 0.5-1% to cohort emergency fund
4. **Pattern Matching**: Cluster users by income SHAPE—match anti-correlated patterns for pooling
5. **Dashboard**: Raw numbers + Pattern visualization + Cohort comparison

**MVP Path:** Start with Layers 1-2 (auto-save + surge capture), add cohort features later

## World 4: DISPLACEMENT

### World Rules
Nothing can be created, destroyed, added, or removed—only displaced. Every change pushes something elsewhere. The universe remembers where things "belong" (displacement memory). Rapid/forced displacements accrue debt that must eventually equalize. No space can remain empty (compensatory filling).

### Solution: Temporal Displacement Banking
- **Displacement Exchange Pool**: Work for elders NOW, creating displacement debt in your favor
- **Ripple Contribution Model**: Irregular contributions create smaller, distributed ripples (safer than forced consistency)
- **Displacement Tension Certificates**: Track how much universe "owes you"—cumulative regardless of timing
- **Compensatory Filling**: Zero-income periods create voids that MUST be filled from high earners—not charity, physics
- **Retirement as Return**: Stop resisting, let displacement memory flow home

**Key Insight:** "We stopped pretending 'consistency' was ever real. All wealth was always displacement."

### Extracted Mechanism
**Label: PORTABLE**

**Core Principle:** Contribution-as-Claim Rather Than Contribution-as-Accumulation—intergenerational transfer as the actual unit of account

**Revelation:** This describes how Social Security already works (PAYGO)—the fictional physics made visible what "savings" metaphors obscure

### Bridge to Reality
1. **Gap-Tolerant Crediting**: Remove penalties for zero/low contribution years; credit caregiving, education
2. **Flexible Contribution Windows**: Allow catch-up during high-earning periods
3. **Displacement Tension Certificates (Real)**: Portable lifetime contribution record across employers, gig work, caregiving
4. **Irregularity-Native Design**: Build schedules expecting 20% of years to have zero contributions
5. **Reframe**: "Intergenerational Claim Ledger" not "Trust Fund"

**Core Insight:** Systems designed around intergenerational transfer reality can accommodate irregular work; systems pretending to be savings accounts cannot.

## World 5: THEATRICAL

### World Rules
Reality is performance. Nothing exists unless observed. Events follow dramatic logic—effects require buildup, shortcuts collapse. You can only act within declared roles. Currency is "Applause"—crystallized audience approval. Solitary work earns nothing.

### Solution: Ensemble Retirement Theater
- **Contribution Troupes**: 12-50 workers witness each other's contributions, crystallizing them into value
- **Dramatic Beats**: Small contributions after hardship carry MORE weight; zero-income = "intermission"
- **Costume Shift Provision**: Public ceremony to change plans without shame of "giving up"
- **Applause Pooling**: Base value + Narrative Multiplier + Ensemble Bonus + Witness Credits for non-contributors
- **Retirement Production**: Witnessed ceremony to properly conclude

**Key Insight:** "The system doesn't require consistency—it requires witnesses."

### Extracted Mechanism
**Label: PORTABLE**

**Core Principle:** Social Witnessing as Commitment Architecture—replace rigid numerical consistency with social accountability and narrative coherence

**Deepest Insight:** Traditional systems punish inconsistency with invisibility (missed payments don't count). This makes inconsistency *visible and legitimate*—a coherent story rather than scattered failures.

### Bridge to Reality
**"Ensemble Retirement" Peer Accountability Layer:**
1. **Contribution Circles**: 12-20 freelancers; monthly video calls sharing contributions (any amount including zero)
2. **Narrative Reframing**: Zero-months = "intermissions"; returning after gap = "dramatic return"
3. **Public Ceremonies**: Opening declaration, costume shifts (formal plan changes), retirement production
4. **Witness Credits**: Gamified points for attending during non-earning periods
5. **Technical Integration**: Wrap existing IRAs with narrative-framing app

**Why It Works:** Addresses #1 reason variable-income workers abandon retirement savings: shame about inconsistency

## Most Promising Mechanisms

### 1. Pattern-Based Cohort Pooling (from PILAUED)
**Why:** Novel and actionable. Current systems group by income level; grouping by income *pattern* (seasonal, project-based, daily-variable) creates natural mutual aid among people whose rhythms align. When your cohort collectively peaks, everyone benefits. Actuarially innovative: pools by risk *timing*, not risk level.

### 2. Streak-Based Engagement Bonuses (from UNIMPATIENT)
**Why:** Directly addresses psychological barrier. The insight that "the hardest part isn't the money—it's staying in the system" reframes the problem. Zero-minimum deposits + streak bonuses + mutual tending pods keep people engaged through lean periods.

### 3. Transaction-Level Micro-Deposits for Both Parties (from CORALLINE)
**Why:** Immediately implementable by gig platforms. When a client pays a freelancer, BOTH get micro-contributions. Creates network effects and competitive advantage through worker loyalty.

### 4. Social Witnessing + Narrative Reframing (from THEATRICAL)
**Why:** Zero cost, high impact. Peer accountability circles that reframe zero-income months as "intermissions" rather than failures prevent shame-based abandonment—the #1 killer of irregular earner retirement plans.

### 5. Irregularity-Native System Design (from DISPLACEMENT)
**Why:** Policy-level insight. Stop retrofitting industrial-age assumptions. Build contribution schedules that *expect* 20% of years to have zero contributions. Credit caregiving, gig gaps, and education as legitimate participation.
