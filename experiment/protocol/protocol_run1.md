# Simulation Protocol Results: Retirement for Variable Earners

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Problem:** How do we build a retirement system for people who don't know how much they will earn next month, where 'consistency' is impossible?
**Context:** ~36% of US workforce in gig work, freelancing, seasonal employment, or informal economy
**Seeds:** limelike, unwilted, cinerator, nephropyosis, fimbrillate
**Worlds Explored:** 5 (parallel)

## World 1: LIMELIKE (Reactive Stabilization)

### World Rules
Everything exists in hungry reactivity seeking its complement. Incompleteness generates attraction. Once bonded, things set permanently. Layered applications create strength over time. Wealth is measured in "reactive potential" — unhardened possibility.

### Solution: Reactive Pool System
- Small irregular contributions carry stronger "attractive fields" than large stable ones
- Workers join pools of 12-30 with complementary volatility patterns
- Pool maintains deliberate incompleteness to preserve attractive force
- Rewards cumulative presence over time (not consistent presence)
- "Hungry reserve" kept deliberately unfunded to attract new resources and help members in hard times
- Exothermic bonding energy redistributes to those in reactive deficit

### Extraction

**Label:** PORTABLE

**Core Principle:** *Vulnerability as connective tissue* — Financial instability becomes the binding agent creating group cohesion, not a flaw to hide. Groups with diverse volatility patterns are more stable than homogeneous groups.

**Bridge to Reality:**
- Recruit pools for *income pattern diversity* (mix of seasonal, gig, salaried workers)
- "Volatility score" gives higher governance weight to irregular earners (inverting typical credit-based power)
- Maintain 70% target funding — the 30% "hungry gap" maintains engagement pressure
- Rights grow with *months of membership*, not dollars contributed
- "Transaction energy" celebration fund when redistribution happens (makes it visible and positive)
- Onboarding explicitly states: "Your unpredictability makes us stronger"

**Real-world analogs:** ROSCAs, mutual aid societies, income-sharing agreements

## World 2: UNWILTED (No Decay)

### World Rules
Nothing loses vitality over time. Resources stockpile without spoilage. Knowledge learned is never forgotten. Change requires conscious, deliberate action. A fixed "enough" number exists that doesn't move.

### Solution: Vitality Capture System
- The problem isn't consistency of contribution — it's simply capture
- "Burst contributions" during good periods
- Zero contributions during lean times cost nothing (no "falling behind" because no decay)
- Calculable "Enough Forever" threshold — once reached, no further contributions needed ever
- Sprint toward the number when able, coast when needed
- Withdrawal requires formal ritual and intention (structural friction protects savings)

### Extraction

**Label:** PORTABLE (with adaptation)

**Core Principle:** *Asymmetric friction + finite target* — Easy deposit, hard withdrawal. Defined finish line removes infinite horizon anxiety. Traditional systems punish inconsistency and have infinite horizons; this inverts both.

**Bridge to Reality:**
- "Freedom Number" calculable target with visual progress tracker
- No penalties for $0 months; aggressive employer matching during contribution bursts
- 72-hour withdrawal delay + stated purpose (friction without punishment)
- "Sprint tracker" during high-contribution months
- "Coast mode" badge removes shame during lean periods

**Must counter-engineer against real-world decay:**
- Auto-invest in inflation-indexed instruments (TIPS, I-bonds)
- Annual "enough number" recalculation shown transparently
- Reframe as "enough for defined period + buffer" not "enough forever"

**Real-world analogs:** FIRE movement's "number," commitment savings devices

## World 3: CINERATOR (Everything Burns to Ash)

### World Rules
All matter tends toward ash. Nothing persists in current form — must be periodically transformed or degrades catastrophically. Ash retains memory and can reconstitute (with drift). Blending sources creates hybrids. Controlled, intentional release beats spontaneous collapse.

### Solution: Ash-Cycle Retirement System
- Contribute proportion of current state (not fixed amounts)
- Variable Ash-Tithe based on current form-debt, not schedule
- "Ember Accounts" accept any size at any time — no schedule, no minimums, no penalties
- "Ash-Binding Collectives" blend contributions — good months enrich pool, lean months absorbed
- "Collective Eternal Flame Cooperatives" democratize access to high-quality preservation
- Drift during reconstitution becomes redistribution — imperfection creates solidarity

### Extraction

**Label:** PORTABLE

**Core Principle:** *State-based timing + friction elimination* — Capture value at moments of abundance, not arbitrary calendars. Lowering cost of "any action" beats optimizing for "correct action."

**Bridge to Reality:**

*Immediate/Low Complexity:*
- Income-triggered micro-contributions: API integration with payroll that auto-adjusts rates during overtime/bonus periods
- Round-up collectives: existing round-up apps but pooled across a group with shared outcome

*Medium Complexity:*
- "Ember Accounts" — no minimum balance, contribution at any time via API triggers (paycheck, reimbursement, windfall)
- Cooperative retirement accounts (50-500 people) pool for institutional-grade investments and fee bargaining
- Penalty-free variable contribution accounts (regulatory sandbox)

*Systemic:*
- Progressive leakage design: fees/slippage deliberately redistributed toward smaller account holders
- Tax code ties retirement incentives to income volatility, not just income level

**Real-world analogs:** Round-up apps (Acorns), auto-enrollment 401(k)s, index funds

## World 4: NEPHROPYOSIS (Accumulation & Release)

### World Rules
Nothing dissipates — everything concentrates into nodes until threshold triggers release. Like pools with like. Strong vessels allow higher thresholds. Discharge flows in predictable drainage patterns.

### Solution: Accumulation Basin System
- Personal "retirement basins" with affinity channels tuned to recognize "surplus"
- Income above survival needs automatically migrates to basin (no contribution decision needed)
- Graduated threshold architecture: multiple chambers with ascending thresholds
- Chamber 1 fills quickly, overflows to Chamber 2, and so on to deep storage
- Irregular drips eventually become stable pools
- "Guild Drainage Networks" share secondary basins among similar workers
- "Employer Tributary System" — payment portions automatically flow to worker retirement at source

### Extraction

**Label:** PORTABLE

**Core Principle:** *Zero-decision extraction + graduated commitment* — Remove the choice point entirely. Make default path lead to accumulation; use tiered friction to convert volatile income into stable reserves.

**Bridge to Reality:**

*Dynamic Surplus Detection Engine:*
- Connect to bank accounts, track income/expenses
- Calculate "survival baseline" (local cost-of-living + necessities)
- Auto-sweep anything above baseline daily/weekly
- User sets baseline once, system handles the rest

*4-Chamber Tiered Liquidity System:*

| Chamber | Fills From | Access | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 (Emergency) | Daily surplus sweeps | Instant, no penalty | 1-3 month buffer |
| 2 (Medium-term) | Overflow from Chamber 1 | 48-hour delay | Major purchases, transitions |
| 3 (Long-term) | Overflow from Chamber 2 | Tax penalty if early | Retirement core |
| 4 (Deep storage) | Overflow from Chamber 3 | Locked until age threshold | Legacy/late retirement |

*Guild Drainage Networks:*
- Profession-specific mutual aid pools (freelancers, gig drivers, seasonal workers)
- Small percentage contributions to shared secondary pool
- Pays out during documented income drops

*Employer Tributary System:*
- Bifurcate paycheck at source
- Worker never "sees" retirement portion in spendable balance

**Real-world analogs:** Digit, Qapital (partial), Australia's superannuation system

## World 5: FIMBRILLATE (Frayed Edges & Filaments)

### World Rules
Nothing has clean boundaries — everything extends filaments that connect and exchange. Entanglement bonds carry memory and essence. No sudden changes, only gradients. Under stress, connections fray outward seeking support (not break). Identity is pattern, not fixed quantity.

### Solution: Frayed Pension / Entanglement Pool
- Massive entanglement structure where participants' financial filaments interweave
- High-earning months = extend further into tangle
- Low-earning months = retract but never detach
- Zero-earning months = draw sustenance through existing bonds
- "Gradient Contribution System" — fraying coefficients increase/decrease smoothly (no cliff edges)
- Entanglement bonds carry memory of past contributions — the tangle remembers your historical weaving
- Identity is "filament signature" (lifetime pattern), not account balance
- System "breathes with the collective's fortune"

### Extraction

**Label:** PORTABLE

**Core Principle:** *Continuous mutual stake with persistent memory* — Replace discrete accounts with weighted membership. Lifetime contribution pattern determines draw rights. No cliff edges or hard cutoffs.

**Bridge to Reality:**

*Gradient Mutual Pension Structure:*
- "Stake-months" weighted by contribution relative to your income at the time (not absolute dollars)
- Low-income contributions count proportionally
- Smooth draw curves: rights increase continuously from age 50-70
- Contribution history modulates the curve (more history = earlier/higher access)

*Pattern-Based Membership:*
- Track contribution consistency over time
- Someone contributing 5% for 30 years has stronger rights than 50% for 3 years
- Identity is behavioral signature, not current state

*Counter-Cyclical Breathing:*
- During collective downturns (recessions), system shifts toward distribution
- During booms, shifts toward accumulation
- Pool breathes with collective fortune

*Fraying Not Breaking:*
- If you stop contributing, draw rights attenuate gradually (10%/year of non-participation)
- You can always rebuild stake by resuming contributions
- Never fully severed

**Implementation vehicles:**
- Reformed Social Security with continuous benefit curves
- Mutual pension co-op (pilot at company/union level)
- DAO-based retirement pool with smart contracts enforcing gradient rules

**Real-world analogs:** Progressive taxation, credit scoring, insurance mutuals, pension pools

## Summary Table

| Seed | Label | Core Mechanism |
|------|-------|----------------|
| limelike | PORTABLE | Volatility as asset — recruit for income diversity, irregular contributors stabilize pools |
| unwilted | PORTABLE | Sprint/coast flexibility + defined "enough" target + withdrawal friction |
| cinerator | PORTABLE | State-based (not calendar) contributions + friction-free any-amount deposits |
| nephropyosis | PORTABLE | Zero-decision auto-sweep + tiered chambers with progressive lock-in |

## Analysis: Most Promising Mechanisms

### Highest Immediate Impact: NEPHROPYOSIS (Auto-sweep + Tiered Chambers)
- Removes decision fatigue entirely
- Already partially exists (auto-enrollment, round-ups) but chambers concept is novel
- Could pilot with fintech/credit union immediately
- Most actionable: tiered liquidity system with automatic overflow

### Most Paradigm-Shifting: LIMELIKE (Volatility as Asset)
- Inverts assumption that irregular = unreliable
- Pools recruited for *complementary volatility patterns* create natural smoothing
- Your unpredictability makes the collective stronger
- Reframes who is valuable to a retirement system

### Key Reframes by Seed

| Seed | What It Reframed |
|------|------------------|
| limelike | Who's valuable (irregular earners as stabilizers) |
| unwilted | The goal (finite target, not infinite accumulation) |
| cinerator | Timing (state-based, not calendar-based) |
| nephropyosis | Agency (automatic, not chosen) |
| fimbrillate | Identity (pattern, not balance) |

## Synthesized Solution

Merge the most portable elements:

**A retirement system that:**
1. **Auto-sweeps surplus** with no decisions required (nephropyosis)
2. **Pools contributors by complementary income patterns** — volatility diversity creates stability (limelike)
3. **Tracks lifetime participation patterns** not account balances (fimbrillate)
4. **Has no cliff edges** for eligibility — just smooth gradients based on weaving history (fimbrillate)
5. **Accepts any contribution at any time** with no minimums or penalties (cinerator)
6. **Defines a visible "enough" number** as motivational target (unwilted)
7. **Uses tiered chambers** that progressively lock funds as they accumulate (nephropyosis)

### Core Design Principles Extracted

1. **Eliminate the decision point** — savings should happen automatically at moments of surplus
2. **Reward duration over amount** — cumulative presence matters more than contribution size
3. **Design for volatility** — irregular income patterns should strengthen, not weaken, the system
4. **Use gradients, not cliffs** — smooth transitions prevent exclusion
5. **Pattern over balance** — identity is behavioral signature over time
6. **Collective breathing** — the system absorbs individual variance through interconnected pooling
7. **Friction asymmetry** — easy in, hard out
8. **Visible finish line** — a calculable target removes infinite horizon anxiety

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Pilot "Ember Accounts"** — savings vehicles with no minimums, API-triggered contributions, pooled investment
2. **Test volatility-diverse pools** — recruit groups with complementary income patterns, measure smoothing effects
3. **Build tiered liquidity prototype** — 4-chamber system with automatic overflow
4. **Design pattern-based membership tracking** — stake-months weighted by relative income
5. **Regulatory sandbox** — test penalty-free variable contribution structures
